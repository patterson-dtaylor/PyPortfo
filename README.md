# My Python Profile @ http://www.taylorpatterson.dev

## This is a Flask_app I developed with a profile in mind to showcase some of my Python skills.

### This profile is ran through a VPS with [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).  It also uses a HTML, CSS, and JS template from [Mash-Up](http://www.mashup-template.com/).  The database, which is a simple function designed to take in messages, was created by me in Flask and complied into a csv file. 

### For updates, please check out the link above.

### Best!
